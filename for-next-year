FROM FEEDBACK FORMS AT END OF COURSES

Stat 603

	- My impression is that variance of student knowledge has 
	  increased, with more who have no stat background.  
	  More need for semester course

	- Lay out the big picture in advance, then gradually fill in
	  and point out where its going to be needed in Stat 621.

	- Allow them more time to finish asking questions.

	- Tie to homework assignments more often.
	- JMP review tied to assignments.
	- Make some part of assignments conceptual. No JMP.

	- Add some of the 621ish feedback review questions.

	- Add supplemental "theoretical" background.

	- Lots of complaints about "pace" being too fast for non-quants.
	- JMP too hard; need more help with software.



(0) My delivery
	- Stop at the end of a sentence that has a major point
	  to give them time to "digest" it.
	- On-line email "chat" sessions in the evening
